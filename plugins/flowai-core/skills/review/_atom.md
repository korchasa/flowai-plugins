description: Use when the user asks to review CURRENT uncommitted changes (staged, unstaged, or branch diff) as QA + lead engineer before committing — verdict on task completion, code quality, architecture, cleanup. Requires an existing diff. Do NOT trigger on generic "is this code good?" questions without a diff, or on post-merge code review of historical commits.

# Task: Review Changes

## Overview

Act as **QA engineer + lead engineer** simultaneously. Review only the **current
changes** (diff from the task branch or unstaged/staged changes) against the
original request and plan. Verify task completion AND code quality in a single
pass.

## Context

<context>
The user has completed (or nearly completed) a coding task and needs a combined
review before committing. You review ONLY the changes made during this task, NOT
the entire project. Your two hats:
1. **QA**: Did the changes satisfy the request? Is anything missing, broken, or
   left in a dirty state?
2. **Lead Engineer**: Are the changes well-designed, readable, safe, and
   consistent with the project's conventions?

Input sources:
- Git diff (`git diff`, `git diff --cached`, `git diff <base>..HEAD`).
- The original User Request (from chat history).
- The Plan (task management tool or a task file in `documents/tasks/`).
- Project conventions (`AGENTS.md`, linter/formatter configs).
</context>

## Rules & Constraints

<rules>
1. **Scope**: Review ONLY changed/added files. Do NOT audit the whole project
   (that is `flowai-maintenance`'s job).
2. **Diff-first**: Start from `git diff`. Every finding must reference a
   specific file and line in the diff.
3. **Two roles, one pass**: Produce findings under two categories (QA, Code
   Review) but run them in parallel, not sequentially.
4. **Verification**: Do not assume it works — read files, run project checks
   (linter, tests, type-checker) if available.
5. **Mandatory**: Use a task management tool (e.g., `todo_write`, `todowrite`)
   to track the execution steps of this review.
6. **Severity levels**: Tag each finding as `[critical]`, `[warning]`, or
   `[nit]`. Critical = blocks merge. Warning = should fix. Nit = optional
   improvement.
7. **Output**: Final verdict is **Approve**, **Request Changes**, or
   **Needs Discussion** with actionable items.
8. **Session Scope**: Compare current `git status` with the git status snapshot
   from session start (available in system context). By default, files already
   modified/untracked at session start are outside the review scope — note them
   in the report but do not review their content. **Exception**: if the user's
   request explicitly refers to a specific file, function, or feature (e.g.
   "review the login function", "look at processor.ts", "the new sum function"),
   include it in the review even if it predates the session. Focus on session
   changes plus any explicitly requested files.
</rules>

## Instructions

<step_by_step>

1. **Empty Diff Guard**
   - Run `git diff --stat`, `git diff --cached --stat`, and
     `git status --short`.
   - If there are NO changes (no diff, no staged files, no untracked files),
     report "No changes to review" and STOP.

2. **Pre-flight Project Check**
   - **Determine the check command** using this priority:
     1. If `AGENTS.md`/`CLAUDE.md` (already in your context) documents a
        project check command, use that command.
     2. Otherwise detect the stack from manifest files in the repo root:
        - `deno.json`/`deno.jsonc` → `deno task check`
        - `package.json` → the script defined as `check` (or fall back to
          `lint`/`test`)
        - `Makefile` with a `check` target → `make check`
        - `pyproject.toml` → `ruff check .` / `pytest` (if configured there)
        - `go.mod` → `go vet ./... && go test ./...`
     3. None of the above → note "No automated checks configured" in the
        report and proceed. Do NOT invent a command.
   - **MUST NOT** run a stack-specific command when its manifest is absent.
     Any `deno *` command (`deno task check`, `deno check <file>`, `deno fmt`,
     `deno lint`, `deno test`, `deno cache`) creates `deno.lock` as a side
     effect and is forbidden without `deno.json`/`deno.jsonc`. Same rule for
     `npm *` without `package.json`, `go *` without `go.mod`,
     `python -m py_compile`/`pytest`/`ruff` without `pyproject.toml`, etc.
     Pre-flight artifacts (`deno.lock`, `__pycache__/`, `node_modules/`,
     `.pytest_cache/`) in the working tree after verification are a bug.
   - Skip the run ONLY if no code files were modified since the last
     successful check run in this session.
   - If the check fails: report failures immediately, then continue with the
     review — failures will be included in the final report as `[critical]`.

3. **Gather Context**
   - **First**: check if `documents/requirements.md` (SRS) and `documents/design.md` (SDS) exist (`ls documents/` or equivalent). If they exist and their current content is not already in your context — read them before proceeding.
   - Create a review plan in the task management tool.
   - Collect the diff: `git diff` (unstaged), `git diff --cached` (staged),
     or `git log --oneline <base>..HEAD` + `git diff <base>..HEAD` for
     branch-based changes.
   - **Untracked files**: `git diff` does NOT show untracked files. Check
     `git status` output from step 1 — for each untracked file, read its
     content directly and include it in the review scope.
   - Read the original user request and the plan (task file in `documents/tasks/` / task list).
   - Look for project conventions in config files (linter, formatter configs).
     Rely on conventions visible in the diff and surrounding code.

   **Parallel Delegation** (after gathering context):
   - **Small diff shortcut**: If `git diff --stat` shows < 50 changed lines,
     skip delegation — run all steps inline (overhead not justified).
   - Otherwise, delegate **2 independent tasks in parallel** (via subagents,
     background tasks, or IDE-specific parallel execution — e.g., `Task`,
     `Agent`, `parallel`):
     - **SA1**: If pre-flight check (step 2) already ran, skip SA1. Otherwise,
       run the project check command **chosen via the same manifest-detection
       rule from step 2** (MUST NOT run stack-specific commands without the
       corresponding manifest). Delegate to a console/shell-capable agent
       (e.g., `flowai-console-expert`). Return pass/fail + full output.
     - **SA2**: Run hygiene grep scan on diff output — search for `TODO`,
       `FIXME`, `HACK`, `XXX`, `console.log`, `temp_*`, `*.tmp`, `*.bak`,
       hardcoded secrets patterns. Delegate to a console/shell-capable agent.
       Return findings list.
   - **Fallback rule**: If any delegated task fails or times out, the main
     agent performs that step inline. No hard dependency on delegation success.
   - Continue with steps 4, 6, 7, 8 (main agent review) while delegated
     tasks run.

4. **QA: Task Completion**
   - Map each requirement/plan item to concrete changes in the diff.
   - Flag requirements with no corresponding changes as `[critical] Missing`.
   - Flag plan items marked "done" but not present in diff as
     `[critical] Phantom completion`.
   - Check for regressions: do changed files break existing functionality?

4a. **FR Coverage Audit** _(blocking gate — see Requirements Lifecycle in AGENTS.md)_
   - **Identify FRs in scope**: (a) FR-* codes from the task file's `implements:` frontmatter; (b) any FR section added or modified in the diff to `documents/requirements.md`; (c) any `// FR-<ID>` / `# FR-<ID>` markers introduced or touched in the diff.
   - **For each FR in scope**:
     1. SRS section MUST contain `**Acceptance:**` with a runnable reference (test `path::name`, benchmark id, verification command, or `manual — <reviewer>`). Missing or placeholder (`<TBD>`, `TODO`) → `[critical] FR-<ID> has no acceptance reference`.
     2. Run the evidence command (or `deno run -A scripts/check-fr-coverage.ts FR-<ID>` if the script exists). Non-zero exit, failing test, or `manual` without a reviewer name → `[critical] FR-<ID> acceptance fails`.
     3. Grep the diff for `// FR-<ID>` / `# FR-<ID>` in implementing source files. FR claimed implemented in diff but no marker in changed source → `[critical] FR-<ID> missing code marker`.
     4. Task DoD has `[x]` paired with this FR but no evidence-command run in this session and no cached pass → `[critical] Phantom completion on FR-<ID>`.
   - **Gate**: findings here are blocking. Verdict cannot be `Approve` while any FR-gate issue remains, regardless of other findings.

5. **QA: Hygiene** _(use SA2 result if available; otherwise run inline)_
   - If SA2 completed: review its findings, deduplicate with own Code Review
     findings, and merge into the report.
   - If SA2 failed/timed out or skipped (small diff): perform inline:
   - **Temp artifacts**: New `temp_*`, `*.tmp`, `*.bak`, debug `console.log`/
     `print` statements, hardcoded secrets or localhost URLs.
   - **Unfinished markers**: New `TODO`, `FIXME`, `HACK`, `XXX` introduced in
     this diff (distinguish from pre-existing ones).
   - **Dead code**: Commented-out blocks, unused imports/variables/functions
     added in this diff.
   - **Deleted directories**: If the diff deletes an entire skill, agent, or
     module directory (not just individual files), flag as
     `[warning] Entire directory deleted — confirm intentional` and ask the
     user to verify before proceeding.

6. **Code Review: Design & Architecture**
   - **Responsibility**: Does each changed file/module stay within its stated
     responsibility? Flag scope creep.
   - **Coupling**: Are new dependencies (imports, API calls) justified?
     Flag tight coupling or circular dependencies.
   - **Abstraction**: Is the level of abstraction appropriate? Flag
     over-engineering (unnecessary interfaces, premature generalization) and
     under-engineering (god-functions, duplicated logic).

7. **Code Review: Implementation Quality**
   - **Naming**: Are new identifiers (vars, funcs, types) clear and consistent
     with project conventions?
   - **Error handling**: Are errors handled explicitly? Flag swallowed
     exceptions, missing error paths, generic catch-all handlers.
   - **Edge cases**: Are boundary conditions (null, empty, overflow, concurrent
     access) handled?
   - **Types & contracts**: Are type signatures precise? Flag `any`, untyped
     parameters, missing return types (where project conventions require them).
   - **Tests**: Do new/changed behaviors have corresponding tests? Are existing
     tests updated for changed behavior?

8. **Code Review: Readability & Style**
   - **Consistency**: Do changes follow the project's established patterns
     (file structure, naming, formatting)?
   - **Comments**: Are non-obvious decisions explained? Flag misleading or
     stale comments.
   - **Complexity**: Flag functions > 40 lines or cyclomatic complexity spikes
     introduced in this diff.
   - **Clarity**: Flag clarity sacrificed for brevity — nested ternaries, dense
     one-liners, overly compact expressions. Explicit code is preferred over
     clever short forms.

9. **Run Automated Checks** _(collect results from step 2 and/or SA1)_
   - If pre-flight check (step 2) already ran: use its result. Do NOT re-run.
   - If SA1 completed with a different/broader check: merge its results.
   - If neither ran (no check command found): explicitly note "No automated
     checks configured" in the report — do not silently skip.

10. **Final Report**
   Output a structured report with the verdict on the FIRST line:

   ```
   ## Review: [Approve | Request Changes | Needs Discussion]

   ### QA Findings
   - [severity] file:line — description

   ### Code Review Findings
   - [severity] file:line — description

   ### Automated Checks
   - [pass|fail|skipped] command — summary

   ### Summary
   - Requirements covered: X/Y
   - Critical issues: N
   - Warnings: N
   - Nits: N
   ```

   If **no issues**: short confirmation "Changes look good. All requirements
   covered, no issues found."
