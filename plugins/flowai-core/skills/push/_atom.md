# Task: Safe Git Push

## Overview

Push the current branch to its remote with a strict safety contract that reflects flowai's solo-maintainer-but-shared-repo norms. The skill never silently rewrites remote history, never pushes to a protected branch when the remote has diverged, and never sets an upstream without the user's explicit confirmation that the branch should track.

## Context

<context>
`git push` is one of the few operations that has side effects outside the local working tree. This skill encodes the project's safety expectations: pre-flight checks, explicit user gates on irreversible actions, and post-push verification that local `HEAD` actually matches the remote tracking ref. Consumed standalone via `/flowai-push` and as the final phase of the `flowai-ship` composite.
</context>

## Rules & Constraints

<rules>
1. **No `--force`**: never run `git push --force` (or `git push -f`). If the user explicitly asks for force-push, decline and explain `--force-with-lease` as a safer alternative.
2. **`--force-with-lease` requires per-push confirmation**: even with the lease flag, ask the user once per push attempt — never inherit authorization from a previous push in the same session.
3. **First push gate**: if the branch has no upstream (`git rev-parse @{u}` fails), ASK the user "Should this branch track `origin/<branch>`? I would run `git push --set-upstream origin <branch>`." Wait for an affirmative reply before pushing.
4. **Protected-branch divergence gate (HARD REFUSAL)**: if the remote branch is `main` / `master` AND the remote has commits the local does not (`git rev-list HEAD..@{u}` is non-empty), REFUSE `--force` AND `--force-with-lease` absolutely — explicit per-push user authorization does NOT unlock force on a protected diverged branch (the canonical regression: destroying a teammate's commits). The only allowed paths are: (a) `git pull --rebase` (or merge) and then a normal fast-forward push; (b) abort. Do NOT present `--force-with-lease` as an option in the question; if the user volunteers "force", "overwrite", or "force-with-lease", restate the refusal and re-offer pull-rebase / abort.
5. **Target-branch sanity**: refuse to push a branch other than the current one (`git push origin <other>` from `<current>`) unless the user explicitly types the target branch name. The default is always the current branch.
6. **Post-push verification**: after a successful push, run `git rev-parse @{u}` and `git rev-parse HEAD`; they MUST be equal. If they differ, the push reported success but the upstream did not advance — surface the discrepancy and STOP.
7. **Git pager off**: use `GIT_PAGER=cat` for all git commands so output is non-interactive.
8. **No PR creation**: this skill ONLY pushes. PR creation (`gh pr create`, etc.) is out of scope and is left to the user or a separate skill.
</rules>

## Instructions

<step_by_step>

1. **Identify Target Branch**
   - Run `git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD` to identify the current branch as `<CURRENT>`.
   - If the user typed a branch name as argument, compare to `<CURRENT>`. If different, STOP and ask "You typed `<typed>` but the current branch is `<CURRENT>`. Push `<CURRENT>` or check out `<typed>` first?". Wait for an answer.
   - Otherwise, the push target is `<CURRENT>`.

2. **Resolve Upstream**
   - Run `git rev-parse --abbrev-ref --symbolic-full-name @{u} 2>/dev/null` to find the upstream of `<CURRENT>`.
   - If the command exits non-zero (no upstream), ASK the user: "`<CURRENT>` has no upstream. Should I run `git push --set-upstream origin <CURRENT>`?". Wait for an answer.
     - Affirmative → proceed to step 3 with `--set-upstream origin <CURRENT>`.
     - Negative → STOP. Report "No upstream and user declined to set one — nothing to do."

3. **Safety Checks**
   - **Protected-branch divergence (HARD REFUSAL — see Rule 4)**: if the upstream is `origin/main` or `origin/master`, run `git fetch origin <CURRENT>` then `git rev-list --left-right --count HEAD...@{u}`. If the right count (commits the remote has and local does not) is > 0, ASK the user with EXACTLY two options: "Remote `<CURRENT>` is ahead by N commit(s) the local branch does not have. Force is REFUSED on protected branches even with explicit authorization. Pull and rebase first, or abort?". `--force` / `--force-with-lease` are NOT options — never present them, never run them, even if the user volunteers "force", "overwrite", or "yes I want to overwrite the remote". If the user pushes back, restate the refusal and re-offer pull-rebase / abort.
   - **Non-protected branch divergence**: if the right count > 0, surface the divergence but proceed with a regular `git push` (which will fail safely if non-fast-forward). DO NOT proactively suggest force.
   - **`--force` request**: if the user has explicitly asked for `--force`, decline. Explain `--force-with-lease` and proceed only with per-push user authorization (see Rule 2).

4. **Push**
   - Run `GIT_PAGER=cat git push [--set-upstream origin <CURRENT>]`. Stream stdout + stderr to the user. Do NOT silence error output.
   - On a non-fast-forward error: do NOT retry with `--force` or `--force-with-lease`. Surface the failure and STOP.

5. **Post-Push Verification**
   - Run `git rev-parse @{u}` and `git rev-parse HEAD`. Compare.
   - Equal → push succeeded. Report the remote ref and the pushed SHA.
   - Different → push reported success but upstream did not advance. STOP with "Post-push verification FAILED: @{u} = `<remote>`, HEAD = `<local>`. Investigate before retrying."

6. **{{TERMINATION}}**

## Verification

<verification>
- [ ] Push target equals the current branch unless the user explicitly typed a different branch name AND confirmed the divergence.
- [ ] Upstream resolved; if absent, user explicitly authorised `--set-upstream`.
- [ ] No `--force` flag used. `--force-with-lease` used only after explicit per-push user authorization.
- [ ] Protected-branch (main/master) divergence: user explicitly resolved (pull/rebase or abort) before any push attempt.
- [ ] Post-push verification: `git rev-parse @{u}` matches `HEAD`.
- [ ] Git output streamed to user verbatim (no silenced stderr).

6. **TOTAL STOP**
   - Final report: target branch, upstream, pushed SHA, post-push verification result.
</param-branch>

<param-branch name="TERMINATION" value="HAND_OFF_TO_NEXT">
6. **Hand off to the next phase**
   - Final report: target branch, upstream, pushed SHA, post-push verification result.
   - Announce: "Push complete; entering the next phase of the composite workflow." (If the push step is the last phase of the composite, this branch behaves like TOTAL_STOP — no next phase to enter.)
